# nya.js

nya.js is a recreation of the neko desktop toy in JavaScript.

## how to use

if you would like to use nya.js, just add: <br> `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dippio/nya.js/main/nya.js" defer> </script>` <br> to the header of your site


if you don't like how nya.js is set up, how it behaves, or how to looks, you are free to make any changes you want, and rehost it (keeping the header would be apprecited though) <br>
download the nya.js file, and add it to the header of your site (! make sure it is deferred !) <br>
eg. `<script src="/js/nya.js" defer> </script>`
