# nya.js

nya.js is a recreation of the neko desktop toy in JavaScript.

## how to use

simply add <br> `<script src="https://tylerbatk.in/misc/nya.js" defer> </script>` <br> to the header of your site. <br>

alternatively, if you don't like how nya.js is set up, how it behaves, how to looks, or if you just don't trust me, you are free to read through the code and make any changes you want (keeping the header would be apprecited though). make sure to defer the script, otherwise it'll break (because i'm a bad programmer) <br>
